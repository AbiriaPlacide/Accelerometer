# Accelerometer
Accelerometer Device with a PIC16. 

PCB Design with an LIS3DH nano accelerometer. It has the ability to be powered over USB or through an external Battery. Can be programmed with a PIC16 In-Circuit Debugger. you can also talk to the accelerometer over I2C to make use it's working. It also has I/O headers to connect to for external RGB LED's
